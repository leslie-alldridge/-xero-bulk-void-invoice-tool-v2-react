# xero-duplicate-invoice-reducer-v2-react

## Goal

Remake my express handlebars daily summarizing app on a more modern stack that includes React.
Learn how to better find and filter duplicates using state
Continue to code daily

### Other points

I'm also wanting to see how reusable my code is, hoping it'll highlight any issues with it / result in huge time savings.

## Todos

add full support for payables (partially done)

deploy and env variables DONE

## Reflections

I learned a lot creating this application. Not only is it much better than my first version, I stumbled across a few bugs and fixed those too. My code was surprisingly reusable and I created this in less than a day. My bulk void tool is much less complex, but to get it running took 3 days in comparison.

My code still has improvements that can be made, and I look forward to working on that in the future. This will help me write even better code that is highly scalable and easy to reuse.
